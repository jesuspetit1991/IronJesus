#In this lab we will find the customers who were active in consecutive months of May and June. Follow the steps to complete the analysis.
#Create a table rentals_may to store the data from rental table with information for the month of May.

use sakila;
select * from rental;

-- 1-Insert values in the table rentals_may using the table rental, filtering values only for the month of May.
create table rentals_may as
select rental_id,rental_date,inventory_id, customer_id,return_date,staff_id, last_update from rental where month(rental_date)= 5;
select * from rentals_may;

-- 2-Create a table rentals_june to store the data from rental table with information for the month of June.
create table rentals_june as
select rental_id,rental_date,inventory_id, customer_id,return_date,staff_id, last_update from rental where month(rental_date)= 6;
select * from rentals_june where month(rental_date) = 6;
select * from rentals_june;

-- 3-Insert values in the table rentals_june using the table rental, filtering values only for the month of June.


-- 4- check the number of rentals for each customer for May.
select * from rentals_may;
select customer_id, count(customer_id) from rentals_may group by customer_id order by count(customer_id) desc; 

-- 5-Check the number of rentals for each customer for June.
select * from rentals_june;
select customer_id, count(customer_id) from rentals_june group by customer_id order by count(customer_id) desc; 

-- 6-Create a Python connection with SQL database and retrieve the results of the last two queries (also mentioned below) as dataframes:
#Check the number of rentals for each customer for May
#Check the number of rentals for each customer for June
#Hint: You can store the results from the two queries in two separate dataframes.

-- 7- Write a function that checks if customer borrowed more or less films in the month of June as compared to May.
#Hint: For this part, you can create a join between the two dataframes created before, using the merge function available for pandas dataframes. 
#Here is a link to the documentation for the merge function.
